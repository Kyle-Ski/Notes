# Stacks & Queues

## Stacks
* Principle for Data Access and Removal: Last In First Out
*A Stack of books*
* Can't access inside the stack without going through all other elements
* **Push:** add a new item to the stack
    - adds it to the top
* **Pop:** remove the top of the stack 
    - returns it to the caller
#### **Examples:**
- browser history
- undo/redo
- call stack

#### Sorting A Stack
*What we know:*
* *have to start at the top and go through piece by piece*
* *have to pop*

##### **So, To sort:**
* Pop each element out into another accumulator
* sort each element
* Push them back into the stack from the accumulator

## Queues
* Principle for Data Access and Removal: First In First Out
*Waiting in lines*
* Opperating from both sides 
    - in from back
    - out from front
* **Enqueue:** Add a new item to the end of the line   
    - a new person enters the line
* **Dequeue:** Take out from the front of the line
    - the person from the front exits the line
#### **Examples:**
- computer start up/sequential
- event scheduler in JS
- job scheduling
